## Description
This source plugin retrieves podcast data from the [Buzzprout API](https://github.com/Buzzsprout/buzzsprout-api).
The Buzzsprout api returns the list of [episodes](https://github.com/buzzsprout/buzzsprout-api/blob/master/sections/episodes.md) for a certain podcast identified by its id.

## How to install

```
npm install --save gatsby-source-buzzsprout-api
```
or
```
yarn add gatsby-source-buzzsprout-api
```

## Available options
* **name** is a string that will be used to identify the created query. It can be an empty string. This allows you to use the plugin multiple times for different podcasts
* **token** This is the [authentication token](https://github.com/Buzzsprout/buzzsprout-api#authentication) for the Buzzsprout API
* **podcastid** This is a number that identifies the podcast

## When do I use this plugin?

If you have a podcast hosted with Buzzsprout you can query the list of episodes and publish them in your site.

## How to use it
```js
// In your gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-buzzsprout-api`,
      options: {
        name: `ControlRemoto`,
        token: process.env.BUZZSPROUT_TOKEN,
        podcastId: '1057351' 
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## How to query for data
After configuration is done two new queries will be available for use

Query is `PodcastEpisode${name}`.

When name of options is ControlRemoto, query named as **PodcastEpisodeControlRemoto**
```graphql
{
  allPodcastEpisodeControlRemoto{
      node {
        title
        description
        audio_url
      }
    }
  

  podcastEpisodeControlRemoto {
    title
    description
    audio_url
  }
}
```

A podcast episode data looks like this
```json
 {
    "podcastName": "SOMENAME",
    "slug":"too_small_or_too_big",
    "remoteImage": {
      ...
    },
    "id":788881,
    "title":"Too small or too big?",
    "audio_url":"https://www.buzzsprout.com/140447/788881-filename.mp3",
    "artwork_url":"https://storage.buzzsprout.com/variants/NABbMDx7JN5bSLzLPXyj67jA/8d66eb17bb7d02ca4856ab443a78f2148cafbb129f58a3c81282007c6fe24ff2",
    "description":"",
    "summary":"",
    "artist":"Muffin Man",
    "tags":"",
    "published_at":"2019-09-12T03:00:00.000-04:00",
    "duration":12362,
    "hq":true,
    "magic_mastering":true,
    "guid":"Buzzsprout788881",
    "inactive_at":null,
    "episode_number":5,
    "season_number":5,
    "explicit":false,
    "private":false,
    "total_plays":150
  },
```

The `remoteImage` attribute is a `remoteFileNode` created by `gatsby-source-filesystem` to optimize the `artwork_url` is meant to be used with `gatsby-plugin-sharp` and `gatsby-transformer-sharp`
